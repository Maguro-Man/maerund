                    How do I even begin to describe humans? They're rash and lack any sense of danger, risking what short lives they have on foolhardy bids at securing a "lasting" legacy. Their idea of "lasting" is lucky to be as long as a single <a href="eldaari.html"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari</span></a> lifetime. But yet, this same tenacity and ambition is what won them their <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">War for the West</span></a> isn't it? I'm loathe to admit it, but I'm always grateful to be standing shoulder to shoulder with a Human when things are looking dire.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Humans from different regions can vary somewhat in appearance, and often differentiate themselves between three main ethnic backgrounds: <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Vrillians</span></a>, <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Serelics</span></a>, and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Tyrilis</span></a>. Vrillians are from the region known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Western Kingdoms</span></a>, and tend to have relatively lightly colored hair and skin. Their most distinguishing feature is the hues of blues and greens that their eyes often take on. Serelics settled what is now known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Central Expanse</span></a>, which lies east of the Western Kingdoms. They are slightly shorter on average than Vrillians and have dark, thick hair, which comes in a variety of textures ranging from straight to curly. South of the Central Expanse is <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Northern Origus</span></a>, home to Tyrilis. Tyrili peoples have notably darker skin than other Humans and are relatively tall as well. They are known for having exaggerated physiques; it is more common that a Tyrili person to be very slender or brawny than to have an average frame. Though these differences between ethnic groups is obvious to most Humans, other races often don't even realize there's a difference between Humans of different regions at all.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Though the Human race has existed as long as most other sentient races, they lived as simple nomads for a large portion of their history. This has led to most other races considerind Humans to be a relatively young race since Human civilization has not been around as long as many others. In spite of this, Human settlements cover more of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Maerund</span></a> than those of any other race due to their extremely quick development and expansion. The first Humans hailed from Northern Origus and would eventually expand north to the Central Expanse when the Human population began to outgrow the available land. It was in the Central Expanse that Human civilization began to quickly advance, and this would eventually lead to another large migration, this time to the west. Several large groups of Humans would go on to stake their claims and found the Western Kingdoms. However, unlike the Central Expanse, the land that the Western Kingdoms sought to take was occupied by significant resistance in the form of the Eldaari. This conflict broke out into a bloody war that would come to be named the &quot;War of the West&quot;, in which the Eldaari were forced to abandon their claim on the entire region. The Eldaari took their <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">capital city</span></a> and used a magic ritual to lift it into the sky in an event known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">&quot;Eldaari Sundering&quot;.</span></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Many Eldaari were left behind in this retreat, and these abandoned Eldaari would become the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani.</span></a> The Feldani quickly organized themselves in the forests that surrounded the now gone Eldaari capital and used brutally efficient guerilla warfare to push back the Human invaders and secure the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a>. Though the expansion of the Western Kingdoms was finally put to a stop, it was only after the loss of the rest of the Eldaari territories. Humans never attempted to invade the lands the Feldani managed to hold, and another war being started by either is seen as unlikely by most, especially with diplomatic relations and trade routes opening up between the two races. However, tensions are not entirely absent and some worry that those who are especially greedy or still hold onto old grudges may one day spark another war. In the meantime, the aggresive expansion of Humans has slowed down as most would object to any wars of expansion, though more adventurous types are still willing to stake claims in more untamed lands.
