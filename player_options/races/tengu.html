        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Tengu are humanoids with features that resemble birds of prey, especially black eagles, with black feathers and yellow beaks. Their feet lay flat on the ground, like those of flightless birds, and the claws are relatively short and flat to facilitate walking. The claws on Tengu hands are steeply curved, allowing the fingers to grasp objects properly without the claws getting in the way. Tengu also possess large wings which protrude from their back, and allow for some limited flight. Unlike animal flying birds, Tengu do not have hollow bones, which makes them relatively tough, but severely restricts their ability to fly due to the increased weight. Some Tengu share features with different types of birds, but this is generally rare and seemingly random. Reactions to the abnormal appearance of these individuals are a matter of personal taste; some Tengu find it attractive, others find it unsettling, and many have no strong feelings about what they see as nothing more than a novel difference in appearance.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The professional military of the Dragon Empire is composed mainly of Tengu, from the lowest ranking foot soldiers to the top of military command. Tengu are credited with taming the most dangerous territories that the Dragon Empire has expanded into, and many now continue their duties by defending the Empire's borders. Though it is not mandatory for Tengu to serve in the military, tradition has made it an obvious path for most. This reputation as the military arm of the Dragon Empire has provided Tengu with respectable social standing, and Tengu lords were granted extremely generous fiefs under the condition they were used construct castles and maintain garrisons. These fiefs were picked from locations around the edges of Empire in order to maintain a Tengu military presence throughout its borders.
