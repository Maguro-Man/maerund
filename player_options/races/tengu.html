                There are many things that go into maintaining a nation, but Tengu pride themselves in what allows a nation to exist: military might. As a race, Tengu are strong and swift, as if naturally built to be warriors. Most are all too happy to put this natural talent to use.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Tengu are humanoids with features that resemble birds of prey, especially black eagles, with black feathers and yellow beaks. Their feet lay flat on the ground, like those of flightless birds, and the claws are relatively short and flat to facilitate walking. The claws on Tengu hands are steeply curved, allowing the fingers to grasp objects properly without the claws getting in the way. Tengu also possess large wings which protrude from their back, and allow for some limited flight. Some Tengu share features with types of birds other than black eagles, but this is generally rare and seemingly random. The lifespan of Tengu is somewhat short, usually living to be a maximum of 60 years old. Adulthood for Tengu is also somewhat earlier than other races, coming about at the age of 16 for most.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The first Tengu made themselves useful to the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Dragon Empire</span></a> by making up most of its military forces, from the lowest ranking foot soldiers to the top of its command structure. This allowed successful Tengu generals to secure a high social status within the Dragon Empire for their contributions to the early expansions of its borders. Many generals and even lower ranking officers were granted generous fiefs at the outermost borders of the empire, so long as they continued to maintain a garrison and defend the lands they were given. Many Tengu that did not make a name for themselves continued serving under these Tengu military officers turned vassals as militiamen or town guards. Others retired to farm the lands now owned by their former commanders or craft arms for their local garrisons. No matter their personal roles in life, nearly all Tengu families have a long history of military service somewhere in it.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Tengu culture places a strong emphasis on honor and obedience, especially when dealing with family and those of higher social rank. Hierarchy is strictly maintained due to the influence of military structure on Tengu families, and elders hold great authority over their lessers in a Tengu family. This attitude goes beyond just familial relationships and affects all levels of Tengu society, such as how employers treat their employees for example. Competence, however, is still important to Tengu and grossly incompetent people in positions of power that refuse to step down eventually draw the ire of most Tengu. Even a parent in a Tengu family that continually proves to be less worthy than their child for a position can end up losing their superior status to their own child. Tengu do not blindly follow anybody with a title, but simply place a value on efficient chains of command when the top of the chain is being effective.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Alignment Religion</h2>
            <p>
                The structured society of Tengu lends to a Lawful alignment, which most Tengu fall under. Tengu that follow military tradition will worship deities concerned with war or duty, while those who do not often look toward deities that value family or order.
