                The Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma and a +1 bonus to Dexterity. <span class="font-italic">Charming and flighty, Feyling are quick in both speech and movement.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Small creature. <span class="font-italic">Feylings are small in stature and very light, with an average height of just a little over 3 feet and weigh 40 pounds on average.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 25 foot land speed.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Feyling Resistance:</span> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic, and magic can't put you to sleep. <span class="font-italic">The minds of Feylings are not easily affected by magic.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Planar Wings:</span> When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast the Feather Fall spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast Fly once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. <span class="font-italic">The move to the material plane has impaired many Feyling abilities, but they can still materialize their wings for short periods of time.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Nature's Friend:</span> Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. <span class="font-italic">Feylings feel at home in nature, and often make friends with the animals that inhabit it.</span></li>
