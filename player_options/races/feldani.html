        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani are a rugged people adapted to their heavily forested home. Though they share a common ancestry with <a href="eldaari.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari</span></a>, Feldani do not have an inherent affinity for magic and have not been physically mutated by its influence like Eldaari have. The short height and lithe figures of Feldani make them well-suited for moving quickly through thickly wooded areas and makes it easier for them to hide their presence. Their skin, hair, and eye colors tend to be darker and more muted, which also lends to their natural affinity for stealth. Feldani also possess very developed canine teeth, and can survive with a totally carnivorous diet &#40;though they are still omnivores and are healthiest when their diet is supplemented with plant material as well&#41;. Though they do not appear physically impressive, Feldani are known for being quite robust and capable of tolerating adverse living conditions. Feldani reach both physical and mental adulthood at age 20, and live for a relatively long time, usually to about the age of 150.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani are descendants of ancient Eldaari broke off of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a> due its oppression of non-mages. At the time the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Schism</span></a> was a political group rather than a separate race, and was made primarily of non-mage Eldaari. Leaving the Eldaari Empire was not a peaceful event, and the empire was not willing to give up its citizens, as well as the resources they wished to take on their journey, without a fight. The group that managed to leave the Eldaari Empire had to be smaller than originally planned to avoid pursuit, but successfully landed on the western coast of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Telaren</span></a> to found the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a>. As millenia passed, Feldani would become their own distinct race &#40;though there is no way of knowing whether Feldani or Eldaari resemble their ancestors more, as Eldaari evolved from arcane mutations&#41;, and form a civilization that outlived the one it fled from.
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani culture values balance of power and fears the consequences of any individual or group holding too much power over others. Though this was historically rooted in the use of magic in the Eldaari Empire, it has become a more general ideal rather than a fear of mages specifically. This has caused individual freedom to be highly valued in Feldani culture, and most consider it distasteful or even immoral to infringe on the freedoms of others. This does not mean Feldani do not believe in community or teamwork, but a good partnership is voluntary for all parties. The right to personal agency is even extended to the natural world by many Feldani, and there has been a conscious attempt by Feldani society to coexist with nature so that it is not completely lost to the tyranny of civilization.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Alignment and Religion</h2>
            <p>
                The freedom-loving Feldani are typically Chaotic, though some are ironically Lawful due to their strict adherence to rules that enforce personal freedoms. They generally worship deities dealing with freedom, nature, or hunting, especially those who live in the wooded lands of the Feldani Confederacy.
