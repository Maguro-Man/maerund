        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani are a rugged people adapted to their heavily forested home. Though they share a common ancestry with the <a href="eldaari.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari</span></a>, the Feldani do not have an inherent affinity for magic and have not been physically mutated by its influence like the Eldaari have. The short height and lithe figures of the Feldani make them well-suited for moving quickly through thickly wooded areas and makes it easier for them to hide their presence. They have olive skin, dark eyes of varying shades, and coarse hair that ranges from shades of blonde to very dark brown. Feldani have also developed noticeable canine teeth, and can survive with a totally carnivorous diet &#40;though they are still omnivores and are healthiest when their diet is supplemented with plant material as well&#41;. Though they do not appear physically impressive, Feldani are known for being quite robust and capable of tolerating adverse living conditions.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani are descendants of the Eldaari who revolted against and overthrew the ancient <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a>. This event is known to the Feldani as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Revolution</span></a> and ended in dramatic loss of life for both sides of the conflict. Because so many were killed, the revolutionaries decided to consolidate their populations to the western regions of the now-collapsed Eldaari Empire and over the course of several millenia began to change from the original Eldaari. While the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Dominion</span></a> would continue to power their cities with magic, exposing their bloodlines to arcane influence, the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a> outlawed magic entirely, executing those caught practicing it if lynch mobs did not reach them first. The lack of magical influence eventually made the Feldani physically distinct from the Eldaari and this would lead to the two peoples being considered completely separate races altogether.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time the Feldani Confederacy would allow magic to be practiced again, acknowledging its usefulness, but heavily regulated its usage. Magic was considered a tool for the people and mages were forced into employment as government agents so that their magic would only be utilized for the public interest. This air of paranoia and suspicion towards magic would later lead to another violent conflict when Human migrants arrived to settle the regions east of the Confederacy. Noticing that Humans had mages among their people, the Confederacy feared that another society like the Eldaari Empire would rise and hostile action was taken immediately to push the invaders out. The fighting was destructive but not decisive for either side, and when the Humans would eventually call for a parley the Feldani realized that there was no apparent elevation of social status for Human mages; in fact, most of their rulers and dignitaries did not seem to possess the ability to use magic at all. Though the Feldani did not immediately trust their new neighbors due to this fact, it lowered their guard enough for them to allow the Western Kingdoms to occupy the lands that formerly composed the eastern territories of the Eldaari Empire.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Society</h2>
            <p>
                Though it has been several millenia since the Feldani Revolution, there still exists suspicion surrounding spellcasters. Though the use of magic itself is no longer looked down upon, there is a fear that those capable of using magic could become a danger to society if given too much power again. Due to this, spellcasters are not allowed to hold any political power, and citizens of the Confederacy must disclose any intentions to pursue arcane research to the relevant government bodies for approval. This research is then closely regulated by public officials and the results are considered property of the Confederacy for use in the public interest. Though spellcasters are otherwise equal to other citizens and possess the same rights, this sort of scrutiny leads many to emigrate to other lands. This is typically not met with too much, if any, resistance, but giving up citizenship in the Confederacy can often mean never being able to return under the same the identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Feldani Confederacy divides its government into three levels: the general consul, fourteen senatorial consuls, and four provincial consuls. The general consul is elected by the fourteen members of the Feldani Senate and retains the position for life unless the Senate votes to remove the general consul from office. The fourteen senatorial consuls were originally made up of prominent leaders of the Feldani Revolution, and deceased or retired members are replaced by an election held by the remaining members. The general consul appoints a provincial consul to each of the Confederacy's four provinces: Fel'Roth, Tar'grim, Sher'lith, and Kul'vin. Provincial consuls are free to appoint their own local officials and can only be appointed or removed by the general consul. This political system leads to most citizens being largely uninvolved in higher levels of government, and some worry it has created a de facto ruling class.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Though the Feldani have separated themselves from the Eldaari, the Feldani still retain their worship of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldra</span></a>, a panetheon of four deities that was worshipped in the Eldaari Empire. Feldani churches dedicated to the Eldra teach that the deities allowed for the success of the Feldani Revolution.
