            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature.   <span class="font-italic">Feldani are both short and slim, with most standing slightly over 5 feet tall, and weighing 100 pounds or less.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 35 foot land speed.  <span class="font-italic">Feldani are not only known for their agility, but also their speed.</span></li>

            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Darkvision:</span> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  <span class="font-italic">Fighting and hunting in dark forests have made Feldani used to low-light conditions.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Guerilla Fighter:</span> If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it.
