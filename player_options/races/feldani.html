        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani are a rugged people adapted to their heavily forested home. Though they share a common ancestry with <a href="eldaari.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari</span></a>, Feldani do not have an inherent affinity for magic and have not been physically mutated by its influence like Eldaari have. The short height and lithe figures of Feldani make them well-suited for moving quickly through thickly wooded areas and makes it easier for them to hide their presence. Their skin, hair, and eye colors tend to be darker and more muted, which also lends to their natural affinity for stealth. Feldani also possess very developed canine teeth, and can survive with a totally carnivorous diet &#40;though they are still omnivores and are healthiest when their diet is supplemented with plant material as well&#41;. Though they do not appear physically impressive, Feldani are known for being quite robust and capable of tolerating adverse living conditions. Feldani reach both physical and mental adulthood at age 20, and live for a relatively long time, usually to about the age of 150.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Feldani are descendants of the Eldaari who revolted against and overthrew the ancient <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a>. This event is known to the Feldani as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Revolution</span></a> and caused the creation of the Feldani race. It is more accurate to say that Feldani resemble ancient Eldaari, as it is the Eldaari who continued to experiment with magic and have become further mutated from their original appearance. The collapse of the Eldaari Empire left the Feldani with dangerous living conditions, as ancient magic devices began to collapse without maintenance and monsters began to settle into all the abandoned ruins. Eventually the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a> would be formed and Feldani civilization would ultimately survive its own birth, and the Eldaari Empire would lay under it, beneath countless generations worth of dirt and sand.
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Much of Feldani culture is informed by the common belief that magic is a dangerous route to giving gifted individuals too much power. Feldani that do choose to pursue the use of magic often choose to leave Feldani territories in favor of living amongst other races that will not view them with suspicion. Individual freedom is highly valued in Feldani culture, and most consider it distasteful or even immoral to infringe on the freedoms of others. This does not mean Feldani do not believe in community or teamwork, but a good partnership is voluntary for all parties.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Deities commonly worshipped by Feldani include <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Beldarin</span></a>, <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Virela</span></a>, and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Agharyx</span></a>. Beldarin has general appeal among freedom-loving Feldaari, Virela is commonly worshipped by hunters, and Agharyx is popular with more vindictive or tempermental Feldani. Some traditionalists prefer to worship <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eilettyn</span></a>, who was the chief deity for the Eldaari Empire.
