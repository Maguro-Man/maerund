                The Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Eldaari are tall and slender, which combined with their long, pointed ears creates a very distinct silhouette, even from a distance. Their eyes are narrow and do not have visible pupils, which many other races can find unnerving. Eldaari blood is inherently imbued with magic, and this arcane influence has turned their skin deep purple and their eyes a glowing amber. Additionally they have lost the ability to grow any hair and cannot digest meat, having become true biological herbivores. Many Eldaari spellcasters begin to develop changes to their physical appearance based on the type of magic they focus on. Spellcasters that have inherent power or gain it through pacts such as <a href="https://5etools.com/classes.html#sorcerer_phb" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">sorcerers</span></a> and <a href="https://5etools.com/classes.html#warlock_phb" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">warlocks</span></a> this is typically based upon the origin of their power: sorcerers gifted by the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Plane of Shadow</span></a>, for example, may have their skin darken or their eyes turn completely black. Learned mages such as <a href="https://5etools.com/classes.html#wizard_phb" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">wizards</span></a> will begin to reflect their chosen focus of study, with necromancers often becoming paler and more sickly in appearance. Such transformations are seen as a sign of individuality among the Eldaari, though many other races often view it as a sign of increasing mutation in a people far too obsessed and reckless in their pursuit of mastery over magic.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The ancient <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a> spanned the entirety of the lands that now consitute both the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a> and all of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Western Kingdoms</span></a> combined. The Eldaari Empire's expansion was fueled chiefly by arcane research which created advancements in both civil and military technologies. Cities glowed in the night with arcane lighting, magic engines propelled iron trains across the empire, and conquest was spearheaded by fire conjured from the heavens. This focus on magic would also be the empire's downfall, however, as those who possessed the ability to utilize magic began to be considered more valuable than those who did not. Eldaari who did not or could not contribute to the magical facets of society became second-class citizens and were forced to occupy the most dangerous and grueling jobs in the empire. War mages became too valuable to waste on petty conflicts and non-magic capable conscripts were often sent to their deaths to test a threat's defenses. Other dangerous occupations such as deep mining and construction were filled almost exclusively by those who could not cast magic. As discontent and tensions rose between the different levels of society, political revolution would rear its head.
            </p>
            <p>
                In what is now known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Revolution</span></a> &#40;though many Eldaari scholars still refer to it as the &ldquo;Ungifted's Revolt&rdquo;&#41;, the lower classes organized themselves throughout the Eldaari Empire and began a coordinated and violent uprising in all of its major cities. Chaos broke out in the streets and any mages, including children and the elderly, were brutally cut down by the revolutionaries. Death was great on both sides of the conflict and it showed no signs of stopping as the days went on, so a meeting was held between the empire's surviving mages, with most communicating through magical means while in hiding. It was decided that they would combine their powers to evacuate themselves and the cities that they still managed to hold against the revolters &mdash; not just the inhabitants of the cities, but the cities themselves. The <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Exodus</span></a> was a massive magical undertaking, that turned four of the last Eldaari Empire's mage-held cities and took them to the skies. The spells kept the cities afloat for nearly one thousand years before wearing off and the cities had to be slowly lowered into the ocean west of the now-fallen Eldaari Empire. The cities are now kept afloat with magic, a shadow of the former glory of the Eldaari.
            </p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Society</h2>
            <p>
                Magic and its uses are still the most important cornerstones of Eldaari society, but the Feldani Revolution had recontextualized its influence on class structure. As all Eldaari today are descended from the original surviving mages of the ancient Eldaari Empire, even those who cannot cast magic are still considered to be part of the same pure bloodline, separate from the revolutionaries who would become the <a href="feldani.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Feldani</span></a>. Additionally, the initially small population size of the group that would found the new <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Dominion</span></a> meant that it was necessary for mages to fulfill roles that were previously considered beneath them. This sense of unity has not been lost and mages and non-mages alike work alongside each other in many of the same roles, throughout all levels of society. Ironically, the society created by those who rejected and fled the Feldani Revolution has become extremely egalitarian between mages and non-mages, while the same cannot always be said for the Feldani Confederacy, which still treats those gifted with magic with extreme suspicion to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Eldaari Dominion is united as a single state, but also splits governance between its four individual cities: Eldriin, Toryl, Oradin, and Celnar. Each city elects a marshal every five years that governs and represents it. The marshal is also in charge of appointing others to additional governmental positions, and the four marshals vote on issues that would affect the Dominion as a whole. As all Dominion citizens come from the bloodlines of similar status, there is no concept of nobility and any individual can better their situation with the right connections and resources. This also makes one's personal merits and reputation extremely important in Eldaari society, though many still hold prejudices toward other races, particularly the Feldani, whom they view as simply inferior, fallen Eldaari. Even the most bigoted Eldaari may set aside their prejudices when dealing with other spellcasters, however, and love sharing knowledge with those equal or better than them at the art. For the Eldaari, progressing civilization through magic will always be a priority.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Almost all Eldaari worship the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldra</span></a>, a panetheon of four deities that they have worshipped since the beginnings of the Eldaari Empire. Though all of the Eldra are sacered to the Eldaari, the most important to them is <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eilettln</span></a>, the goddess of magic. Some mages of other races also worship Eilettln, but the Eldaari believe her responsible for the existence of all magic in Maerund, including the divine and even the profane.
