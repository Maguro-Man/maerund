                Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Eldaari are tall and slender, which combined with their long, pointed ears creates a very distinct silhouette, even from a distance. Their eyes are narrow and do not have visible pupils, which many other races can find unnerving. Eldaari blood is inherently imbued with magic, and this arcane influence has turned their skin deep purple and their eyes glowing amber. Furthermore, Eldaari have also developed extremely long lifespans, though at the cost of much lower birth rates. Physical maturation for an Eldaari is at around 20 years of age, but most Eldaari are not considered to be adults until they are at least 50 years old. They can live for upwards of 500 years if not killed by illness or injury, but most female Eldaari can give birth only once before becoming completely infertile. Lucky Eldaari are known to be able to have two or even three children, but some unlucky women are infertile to begin with.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The great <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a> was the most advanced civilization <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Maerund</span></a> has ever known and has existed far before <a href="humans.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Humans</span></a> even developed a capacity for language. This ancient civilization  was fueled chiefly by arcane research which created advancements in both civil and military technologies. Cities glowed in the night with arcane lighting, magic engines propelled iron trains across the empire, and conquest was spearheaded by fire conjured from the heavens. The Eldaari Empire would not last, however, and a catastrophe known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">The Black Hour</span></a> destroyed the entire empire, leaving behind the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Scarred Wastes</span></a>. What actually occurred in The Black Hour was lost to history, but all that is known is that no traces of the Eldaari Empire were visible on the surface of Maerund, and that the only survivors were inhabitants of experimental flying cities that no longer had access to the technology keeping them afloat. These survivors took their cities eastward and used what resources they had to magically anchor the cities to the ocean floor, forming the the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Dominion</span></a>.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                 Due to their long lifespans and low birth rates, Eldaari value patience and caution in all affairs. Taking risks is not worth it when a single death could be the end of an entire family line. This also means a long-lived Eldaari warrior or adventurer can be assumed to either be incredibly careful, incredibly dangerous, or, as is more often the case, both. Though magic has always been important to the Eldaari, and those that possess the ability to harness it are held in high esteem, the struggle Eldaari face in rebuilding their population and the mysterious nature of The Black Hour has made many Eldaari cautious of magical experimentation. The use of magic saved the Eldaari people in the end, but another massive blow to their population would likely be impossible to recover from.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the importance of magic for Eldaari, many of them choose to worship <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eiletynn</span></a> over other deities. <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Ragnvaldr</span></a> and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Thaldar</span></a> are also popular among those who value stability and order. Those who cannot use magic themselves usually worship deities related to their own professions or values, but many non-mage Eldaari choose to worship Eiletynn in spite of their lack of magical abilities.
