                Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Eldaari are tall and slender, which combined with their long, pointed ears creates a very distinct silhouette, even from a distance. Their eyes are narrow and do not have visible pupils, which many other races can find unnerving. Eldaari blood is inherently imbued with magic, and this arcane influence has turned their skin deep purple and their eyes glowing amber. Furthermore, Eldaari have also developed extremely long lifespans, though at the cost of much lower birth rates. Physical maturation for an Eldaari is at around 20 years of age, but most Eldaari are not considered to be adults until they are at least 50 years old. They can live for upwards of 500 years if not killed by illness or injury, but most female Eldaari can give birth only once before becoming completely infertile. Lucky Eldaari are known to be able to have two or even three children, but some unlucky women are infertile to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many Eldaari spellcasters can also begin to develop changes to their physical appearance based on the type of magic they focus on. Spellcasters that have inherent power or gain it through pacts such as <a href="https://5etools.com/classes.html#sorcerer_phb" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">sorcerers</span></a> and <a href="https://5etools.com/classes.html#warlock_phb" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">warlocks</span></a> this is typically based upon the origin of their power: sorcerers gifted by the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Plane of Shadow</span></a>, for example, may have their skin darken or their eyes turn completely black. Learned mages such as <a href="https://5etools.com/classes.html#wizard_phb" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">wizards</span></a> will begin to reflect their chosen focus of study, with necromancers often becoming paler and more sickly in appearance. Such transformations are seen as a sign of individuality among Eldaari, though many other races often view it as a sign of increasing mutation in a people far too obsessed and reckless in their pursuit of mastery over magic.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The ancient Eldaari once occupied the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a>, which spanned the entirety of the lands that now consitute both the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a> and all of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Western Kingdoms</span></a> combined. The Eldaari Empire's expansion was fueled chiefly by arcane research which created advancements in both civil and military technologies. Cities glowed in the night with arcane lighting, magic engines propelled iron trains across the empire, and conquest was spearheaded by fire conjured from the heavens. The Eldaari Empire would not last, however, and would eventually collapse in the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Revolution</span></a> &#40;referred to by many Eldaari scholars as the &ldquo;Ungifted's Revolt&rdquo;&#41;. The last of the Eldaari Empire's cities still held by its rulers now float off the western coast of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Telaren</span></a>, and make up the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Dominion</span></a>.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Magic has always been important to the Eldaari, and those that possess the ability to harness it are held in high esteem. Though it is considered old-fashioned bigotry to look down on those who cannot use magic, there are some Eldaari mages who view non-mages as inferior beings. Due to their long lifespans and low birth rates, Eldaari value patience and caution in all affairs. Taking risks is not worth it when a single death could be the end of an entire family line. This also means a long-lived Eldaari warrior or adventurer can be assumed to either be incredibly careful, incredibly dangerous, or, as is more often the case, both.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the importance of magic for Eldaari, many of them choose to worship <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eiletynn</span></a> over other deities. <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Ragnvaldr</span></a> and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Thaldar</span></a> are also popular among those who value stability and order. Those who cannot use magic themselves usually worship deities related to their own professions or values, but many non-mage Eldaari choose to worship Eiletynn in spite of their lack of magical abilities.
