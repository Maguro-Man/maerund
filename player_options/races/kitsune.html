                Fallen from divinity and exiled for unspeakable crimes, Kitsune are a race with a troubled past. Somehow Kitsune have brought themselves back into the civilized world, now embracing their mortality and working to develop new relationships with the inhabitants of Maerund.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Kitsune resemble <a href="races/humans.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Humans</span></a> but have vulpine ears and tails. They also have much more prominent canine teeth than Humans do, which lends itself to a diet that favors proportionally more meat than vegetation. Kitsune eyes resemble those of foxes as well, and come in a striking variety of bright colors, which can be both beautiful and unnerving depending on who one asks. The physical builds of Kitsune are comparable to that of shorter Humans, with the tallest Kitsune reaching a height of about five and a half feet. Their divine origins grant Kitsune a fairly long lifespan of about 150 years on average, though they reach adulthood at about the same rate as Humans.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Kitsune were not originally mortal, but were demigods created by the goddess <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Amaterasu</span></a> for her own amusement. When they were made mortal, Kitsune were driven mad when they realized life would not only bring them new joys, but also new suffering. Kitsune began to perform profane sacrifices to regain their immortality in a string of murders known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Blood Scourge</span></a>. The combined forces of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Dragon Empire</span></a> would put an end to the experiments with force and banished the Kitsune people to the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Scarred Wastes</span></a>, a vast desert north of the Dragon Empire. The settlements established by Kitsune in the region would grow to become the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Great Merchant Clans</span></a>; these roving trader clans would work to bringing Kitsune out of isolation and earn the trust of the other races of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Maerund.</span></a>
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Many Kitsune are travelers by nature, making their fortunes as traders and treasure hunters. Though this is not universal, a Kitsune settlement still needs farmers and tradespersons to create food and goods, free time is still often spent on travel, whether it is a trip to a nearby city or a quick rest away from home. Though some pockets of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Sunsworn</span></a> cultists still exist, most Kitsune harbor feelings of guilt and shame for their ancestors' role in the Blood Scourge and make efforts to cultivate positive relationships with other races. The horrific consequences of trying to fight their mortality has led Kitsune to appreciate the small joys in life, and to understand bad times are only temporary if one can fight through them.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Kitsune culture values both personal freedom and forgiveness, leading many Kitsune to worship <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Beldarin</span></a> and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Fereleos</span></a>. Kitsune travelers often pray to Beldarin or even <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Di Jun</span></a> that they will be safe and see exciting sights on their journey, while Fereleos is popular with those who wish to find redemption for the atrocities committed by the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Sunsworn</span></a>.
