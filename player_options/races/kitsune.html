                The Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <h2 class="h4">Racial Traits</h2>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma and a +1 bonus to Intelligence. <span class="font-italic">Kitsune are naturally clever, and are adept at leveraging this wit in negotiations with others.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature. <span class="font-italic">Most Kitsune are a little over five feet tall, and their weight is comparable to that of humans of similar height.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 30 foot land speed.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Daitien.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Darkvision:</span> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. <span class="font-italic">Ancient kitsune were nocturnal and developed effective night vision.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Divine Ancestry:</span> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. <span class="font-italic">Though they have been mortal for most of known history, Kitsune retain some hint of their divine nature.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Shrewd Negotiator:</span> You have proficiency in the Persuasion and Insight skills. <span class="font-italic">Part of a Kitsune's natural talent for negotiation is not just in persuasiveness, but also their ability to read others.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Divine Grace:</span> As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. <span class="font-italic">The little divine power still present in Kitsune can be channeled as healing magic.</span></li>
