                Nordingard is a harsh land, inhabited by terrible beasts and covered in an eternal frost. Yet the Dwerger have managed to carve a home out of it, and not even giant tribes or great wyrms have managed to move them from it. Stubbornness is less of a character flaw and more of a necessary skill for most Dwerger.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Example Names</h2>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Male Given Names&#58;</span> Aelfric, Eyvindr, Fridwald, Godric, Sigmundr</li>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Short in height, wide in frame, and exceedingly proud of their beards &#40;the men are at least, not even Dwerger women can grow beards&#41;, it is easy to recognize a Dwerger's distinctive appearance. The average Dwerger weighs about the same as the average Human, but this weight is concentrated in a much shorter and wider frame. This makes Dwerger appear to be somewhat comically clumsy in their movements at times, but they are actually extremely stable and sturdy. Their time in the frigid environment of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Nordingard</span></a> has also made Dwerger resilient to the cold, and their all-around toughness makes it easier for them to deal with hostile environments in general. Male Dwerger grow and maintain long beards in adulthood while female Dwerger do the same with the hair on their heads. Adulthood for Dwerger comes at the age of 16 on average they live to the age of 100.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Dwerger originate from the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Deep Realms</span></a>, where they constructed the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Gilded Halls</span></a>, a massive underground kingdom. The Gilded Halls prospered and Dwerger made technological advancements by utilizing the magical ore they mined from the Deep Realms, creating wonders beyond the understanding of any on the surface world. However, this golden era came to an end when the Dwerger were forced out of their home by invading forces that were expanding from even deeper levels of the Deep Realms. The proud Dwerger resisted but eventually were forced to retreat, and decided to collapse the Gilded Halls so that their invaders could not take them. The Dwerger decided they would go to the surface world and traveled north to the frigid wastes of Nordingard. The lands of Nordingard were not unoccupied however; various giant tribes were already fighting each other to occupy the more hospitable southern portions of Nordingard. It was here that the Dwerger would make their stand and fight off the giants, establishing the city of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Irenhom</span></a>.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The harsh living conditions that the Dwerger must deal with in order to surive has created a culture that values personal strength and resilience. Carrying one's own weight is extremely important in Dwerger society and a person who can protect others as well as themselves is even more valued. Despite the strong warrior culture in Dwerger society, all honest roles in society are respected and valued, no matter how minor or unglamorous. Dwerger culture is still reasonable in its expectations of others; children and elderly would not be expected to provide the same types of contributions as a healthy adult. Though heroism and glory found in battle is highly respected by Dwerger, that does not mean a Dwerger would turn their nose up at an honest tradesman for making a steady living.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Alignment and Religion</h2>
            <p>
                The alignments of Dwerger are varied in practice, but most strive to be Good in their ideals. Deities related to honor and battle are popular due to the warriof culture of Dwerger, but the worship of any deities related to one's profession or the upkeep of Dwerger society is just as common.
