                Nordingard is a harsh land, inhabited by terrible beasts and covered in an eternal frost. Yet the Dwerger have managed to carve a home out of it, and not even giant tribes or great wyrms have managed to move them from it. Stubbornness is less of a character flaw and more of a necessary skill for most Dwerger.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Short in height, wide in frame, and exceedingly proud of their beards &#40;the men are at least, not even Dwerger women can grow beads&#41;, it is easy to recognize a Dwerger's distinctive appearance. The average Dwerger weighs about the same as the average Human, but this weight is concentrated in a much shorter and wider frame. This makes Dwerger appear to be somewhat comically clumsy at times, but they are also extremely stable and sturdy for it as well. Their time in the frigid environment of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Nordingard</span></a> has also made Dwerger resilient to the cold, and their all-around toughness makes it easier for them to deal with difficult conditions in general. Male Dwerger grow and maintain long beards in adulthood while female Dwerger do the same with the hair on their heads.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The Kingdom of Nordingard was not the original home of the Dwerger, but the one they were forced to migrate north to after they were displaced by the growing <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eldaari Empire</span></a>. Refusing to be exterminated like so many others before them, the Dwerger chose to travel north to lands they were not even sure they could survive in. When they arrived the Dwerger were met by not only barely liveable temperatures, but also hostile tribes of giants warring with each other over territory; these giants were already busy defending their lands from rival tribes and were not particularly inclined to sharing them with an unrecognized race. It was here that many Dwerger would find glory by slaying the giants that the initial settlements of Nordingard would be built upon. Many lives were lost, not just in war with the giants, but to the elements and all manner of terrible beasts. Yet, the Dwerger would persevere and began to spread their populations across the frigid north.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spreading their borders was no easy task however, and Nordingard never became easy to live in even as it progressed from a single city to a sizeable country. Due to all the common enemies that inhabited the northern regions, most Dwerger stayed united under the banner of Nordingard, but some daring upstarts went off into the frozen wastes to found their own clans. Suitable land was rarely unclaimed however, and a lucky clan would manage to fend off a small tribe of giants while especially unlucky ones would find a less than amused dragon returning to its roost. Eventually Nordingard would expand its borders far enough to gain access to the ocean, opening up contact and trade with other civilizations.
            </p>        
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Society</h2>
            <p>
                The harsh living conditions that the Dwerger must deal with in order to surive has created a culture that values personal strength and resilience. Carrying one's own weight is extremely important in Dwerger society and a person who can not only keep themselves alive, but protect the community around them becomes an extremely honored member of the community. Nordingard is a monarchy, and independent clans also maintain hereditary lines of governance, but this does not excuse an heir from having to prove their personal merits. Dwerger kings are warrior kings, outdoorsmen, and should be better suited to survive out in the wild than the commonfolk. Particularly weak rulers often step down to allow a better-suited relative take their position, and those who do not usually end up in an assassination plot or end up overthrown and exiled &mdash; exile from the walls of Nordingard is often an execution in and of itself however.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the strong warrior culture in Dwerger society, all honest roles in society are respected and valued. A good king in Nordingard respects the town watch as much as his generals, a merchant as much as a farmer, and ensures that all are suitably rewarded for their efforts. Wealth is not be held by the ruling class in Dwerger culture; the measure of a good leader is how wisely he distributes his coin between his subjects. Naturally, the king of Nordingard is not expected to meet every citizen individually, and instead grants land and resources to various jarls who each control their own region of Nordingard. As rulers of their individual lands, jarls are expected to share their wealth with subjects living within their territory. As with the properties given to them by their king, wealth given out by jarls is not a gift, but is to be granted as rewards for worthy achievements and services to the community or royal families. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Dwerger practice a form of ancestor worship, worshipping the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Ancestor Paragons</span></a>, four ancient Dwerger that are said to have achieved godhood by forming the foundations of the Dwerger people. All four are held in equal regard, and individuals or groups choose to worship the Paragon that they can most relate to or strive to become an exemplar for.
