                The Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma and a +1 bonus to Wisdom. <span class="font-italic">Natural rulers, the Tatsu are eloquent speakers and prudent actors.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature. <span class="font-italic">Tatsu are tall and graceful, averaging six feet tall with an average weight of 150 pounds.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 30 foot land speed.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Daitien.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Dragon Breath:</span> You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your Imperial House determines the damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in a 15 foot cone must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your breath type. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest. <span class="font-italic">The draconic ancestry of the four Imperial Houses has granted them the ability to unleash dragon's breath.</span></li>
