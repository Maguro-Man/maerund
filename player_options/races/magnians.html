                The Eldaari are long-lived, far-sighted, and most of all, extremely proud. Their race has outlived many others, and those that mock their meticulous planning and patience in all affairs simply have not seen as much as the Eldaari have.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Magnians resemble lowland gorillas, but with many distinct features owing to their humanoid nature. Magnians' faces are more defined and expressive than the animals they resemble, and they are suited for bipedal movement &#40;though over long distances most Magnians choose to walk assisted with their arms&#41;. Magnians are born with black fur covering most of their bodies other than their face, hands, and feet, and this fur begins to gray with age. Silver fur is respected as a sign of wisdom and reaching middle age; even more esteemed is the white fur that comes toward the end of life. The fur on the top of Magnians' heads grows long enough to be styled as hair distinct from the rest of their bodies, and male Magnians can have facial hair that grows on the sides and bottom of their face as well. Magnians have similar lifespans to <a href="humans.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Humans</span></a>, living to an average age of 70 years old and reaching physical adulthood from anywhere between 15 and 18 years of age, but typically finish mental maturation at the age of 18.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                The earliest stages of Magnian society were brutal and warmongering, composed of rival tribes led by patriarchal warchiefs whose power was absolute until a younger tribe member would inevitably slay them for their positions. As populations grew and became more united these primitive systems of cyclical warfare and regicide would no longer be acceptable and warchiefs were forced to give up their power and tribalism fell out of favor altogether. Magnians coming out of such turbulent times sought stability and so the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Magnar Imperium</span></a> was created upon the back of a philosophical revolution based around filial piety, civil obedience, and honorable conduct. Though war amongst Magnians continued for some time due to resistance against the rising Magnian Imperium, as many tribes and warchiefs did not swear fealty to the new nation willingly, when it came to an end there was a new era of growth and advancement for Magnian society.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Family and community are the bedrock of Magnian culture, making most Magnians very social people. Young Magnians are eager to prove their worth to the society they live in and most expect to have children and start their own families later in life. Magnians that strike out as adventurers fulfill these values in their own ways by helping the communities they come across in their travels and forming makeshift families with the companions they meet along the way. Respect for one's elders and figures of authority is also an important part of Magnian culture, even when the superior in question is not necessarily in the right. This does not have to mean outright obedience in every situation, but Magnians try to be respectful if defying somebody above their station and prefer to part ways politely rather than argue their point.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Alignment and Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Most Magnians lean toward Lawful alignments and worship deities with agendeas related to community, order, or family. Chaotic individuals do not typically fit in with Magnian society, which they find too stifling and hierarchal, and often set off to live among other races.
