                Humans may not possess any extraordinary physical attributes, but their persistence and ambition more than makes up for it. Though they are a relatively young race compared to the other civilized races of Maerund, Humans have spread their settlements as far as, and often farther than, their older neighbors.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Humans from different regions can vary somewhat in appearance, and often differentiate themselves between three main ethnic backgrounds: <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Vrillians</span></a>, <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Serelics</span></a>, and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Tyrilis</span></a>. Vrillians are from the region known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Western Kingdoms</span></a>, and tend to have relatively lightly colored hair and skin. Their most distinguishing feature is the hues of blues and greens that their eyes often take on. Serelics settled what is now known as the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Central Expanse</span></a>, which lies east of the Western Kingdoms. They are slightly shorter on average than Vrillians and have dark, thick hair, which comes in a variety of textures ranging from straight to curly. South of the Central Expanse is <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Northern Origus</span></a>, home to Tyrilis. Tyrili peoples have notably darker skin than other Humans and are relatively tall as well. They are known for having exaggerated physiques; it is more common that a Tyrili person to be very slender or brawny than to have an average frame. Though these differences between ethnic groups is obvious to most Humans, other races often don't even realize there's a difference between Humans of different regions at all.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Though the Human race has existed as long as most other sentient races, they lived as simple nomads for a large portion of their history. This has led to most other races considerind Humans to be a relatively young race since Human civilization has not been around as long as many others. In spite of this, Human settlements cover more of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Maerund</span></a> than those of any other race due to their extremely quick development and expansion. The first Humans hailed from Northern Origus and would eventually expand north to the Central Expanse when the Human population began to outgrow the available land. It was in the Central Expanse that Human civilization began to quickly advance, and this would eventually lead to another large migration, this time to the west. Several large groups of Humans would go on to stake their claims and found the Western Kingdoms. However, unlike the Central Expanse, some of the land that the Western Kingdoms sought to occupy neighbored the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Feldani Confederacy</span></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Feldani were initially hostile to the newly arrived Humans, and a bloody conflict erupted over the course of three weeks before the Human leaders called for a parley. Realizing that the Feldani were not to be trifled with, an agreement was made that allowed the Western Kingdoms to be founded so long as they did not encroach upon Feldani territories, leaving an occupied buffer zone between Human and Feldani borders. This shaky truce has evolved into a more respectful relationship, with both trade and emigration bringing the two races closer together. Despite this, both races are still stayed wary enough of the other to keep their borders protected. As time went on, the Human ambition to spread its peoples even farther would not end, and more adventurous individuals would continue to seek and explore untamed lands to settle.
            </p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Society</h2>
            <p>
                Northern Origus is home to Humans' oldest civilizations, the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Tyrili Nations</span></a>. Their monarchies are millenia old and most influential families have had their wealth and power passed down for many generations. Though royal families hold the highest positions in government, lower positions as well as the rest of society are not dictated directly by blood. A poor farmer may one day become a successful merchant without resistance from any laws or societal rules, but his economic disadvantages still make this difficult and unlikely. Similarly, no conventions forbid a monarch from appointing a lowborn individual to his or her court if they are worthy of the position, but commonfolk are not likely to get a chance to meet their rulers in the first place. Though this creates a strong sense of hierarchy in Tyrili soceities, a strong sense of community also encourages respect between all levels of society. It is considered virtuous for those of high society to appreciate the contributions of the peasantry to keeping civilization afloat, though in practice most are just barely civil to those of inferior class, particularly if they were born into their higher status. This is no guarantee that those who move up in society will have positive relationships with their former peers however, with many choosing to solidify their newfound position by only maintaining relationships with those of similar or higher social status.
            </p>
            <p>
                The period of greatest growth for Human civilization was in their rapid expanse through the mostly unoccupied Central Expanse. Decades of war in the region led to the rise of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Serelic Empire</span></a>, which occupies most of the Central Expanse. Despite being one single political entity, the Serelic Empire is not a culturally homogenous state. The conquered territories that make up the Empire have kept their individual cultures and the empire's government represents the different regions that make it up. The emperor is elected every ten years by a council of twenty senators that represent five provinces: Serelin, Aryx, Torpus, Qi'ari, and Fredan. These senators are elected by popular vote in their particular regions every five years, and can come from any level of society. The democratic system makes every citizen of the Serelic Empire involved in their own governance, and there is a strong focus on individual duty and loyalty to the empire. Civil disobedience is harshly punished and considered dishonorable as it threatens the structure of society for all of one's peers as well. Conversely, civil service is highly respected and positions such as military service may not be comfortable or well-paying, but are held in high esteem, which can lead to more favorable positions upon retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the ascent of the Serelic Empire, many left to form their own independent states now known as the Western Kingdoms. Their development diverged greatly from that of the Serelic Empire, creating new monarchies supported by powerful aristocracies. Society in the Western Kingdoms is strongly stratified, with the monarchy holding absolute authority to rule, followed by the nobility possessing the right to occupy higher positions in society, with the commonborn being limited to the lowest levels of society available. This is not to say commonborn are not able to obtain any power or prestige whatsoever; successful merchants or tradespersons may accumulate enough wealth to be involved with higher levels of society, though they may still never be considered nobility except through marriage or adoption. This division between different levels of society often leads to conflict and contempt, with nobility looking down on upstart commoners that dare to gather wealth and power, and commoners resenting nobility that act superior due to their birthright. Though some may accept the way Vrillian society functions, most lowborn feel unfairly disadvantaged, and often end up seeking to improve their station by any means necessary. Crime and scheming are everyday companions to life in the large cities of the Western Kingdoms.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Most Humans worship one of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Elysians</span></a>, a family of six deities that are believed to have granted Humans sentience. Churches in the Tyrili Nations are typically built by local communities and all contribute to their construction and maintenance. These small churhces tend to be dedicated to individual deities that are particularly favored in that community. The Serelic Empire dedicates taxes toward the construction and maintenance of churches dedicated to the pantheon as a whole in all of its regions, making sure that all citizens have a place to worship. In the Western Kingdoms, churches are not officially state-funded, but are typically built with donations from both royalty and nobility, leading the most extravagent churches to be built near the properties of the most powerful people in society. These lavish buildings tend to be dedicated to whichever particular deity is favored by the family that has paid for its construction. There also exists more modest community churches like those seen in the Tyrili Nations built by commoners that cannot or do not wish to make the journey to a church built by the upper classes.
