                Humans may not possess any extraordinary physical attributes, but their persistence and ambition more than makes up for it. Though they are a relatively young race compared to the other civilized races of Maerund, Humans have spread their settlements as far as, and often farther than, their older neighbors.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Human appearance can vary drastically compared to other races, especially when they come from different regions. The heights, skin color, and hair texture of Human populations can change over the course of several hundred years to better suit their environments, though the distinctions between different ethnic groups of humans are very rarely noticeable to non-Humans. Physical maturation for Humans typically finishes between the ages of 15 and 18, though adulthood in most Human cultures is considered to be toward the latter years of that timeline, as mental development continues for several years after a Human's physical body has finished maturing. The average Human lives for 70 years.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Though the Human race has existed as long as most other sentient races, they lived as simple nomads for a large portion of their history. This has led to most other races considerind Humans to be a relatively young race since Human civilization has not been around as long as many others. In spite of this, Human settlements cover more as much of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Maerund</span></a>'s as those of any other individual race due to their extremely quick development and expansion. The <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Serelic Empire</span></a> was the first major Human civilization and it did not like long for some of its citizens to travel further north to stake their own claims, forming the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Vrillian Kingdoms</span></a>.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The cultures and societies of Humans can be as varied as their appearances between regions. They have no natural affinity toward chaos or law, good or evil, and different Human cultures can have drastically different values and traditions. Some commonalities many Humans share are their ability to adapt compared to most other races, a general willingness to seek more than they have, and perseverance even in grim situations. Humans tend to respect those who achieve success through their own ingenuity, strength, or even luck, but even this can depend on if an individual comes from an aristrocratic society that values birthright.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Alignment and Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Humans are extremely varied in their alignments and religions, with no particular calling toward anything in particular as a race. Some Humans will have an inherent calling related to their own personality, while others will be heavily influenced by their family or cultural upbringing.
