                Their movements may be slow, but the mind of a Genbu is anything but. In the Dragon Empire Genbu are valued as philosophers, strategists, and advisors due to their inherent sagacity. This sort of wisdom would lead most Genbu to realize a life of adventure is neither stable nor safe, but such insight can't account for individual personality.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Genbu are bipedal, humanoid tortoises that stand upright, although many walk with a slight hunch to help support the weight of the thick shells that protect their backs. The leathery scales of Genbu can vary somewhat in color, with the most common colors being shades of brown, yellow, and green. Genbu shells have a similar range of color variance, but many Genbu choose to decorate their shells or paint them with vivid colors that may represent anything from one's ancestry to one's age and occupation. Genbu are somewhat stocky, but not as much as their weight would suggest; the majority of a Genbu's weight actually comes from their extremely dense and protective shells. It takes a relatively long time for Genbu to reach adulthood compared to most other races, about 25 years, and have an average lifespan of 200 years.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                When the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Dragon Empire</span></a> was formed it was the Genbu that were chosen to make many decisions in its governance. Quickly gaining a reputation for fairness and wisdom in their suggestions, Genbu earned respect as the moderating presence behind the ruling <a href="../races/tatsu.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Tatsu</span></a>. However, the sage advice of prominent Genbu was not only used for civil services, and many <a href="../races/tengu.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Tengu</span></a> generals kept Genbu retainers as military advisors. More ambitious Genbu chose not to offer their services as advisors at all, instead striking out on their own to become merchants or claim their own land. Many of these enterprising individuals would become founders of long-lasting merchant families or even see their land develop into fully-fledged cities through the generations.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Knowledge is extremely valuable to Genbu, not just its procurement, but also its application. Knowledge is not only useless if lost, but also if it not used in some way. Many Genbu look to history and the wisdom of their elders when making decisions so that they can learn lessons from past mistakes instead of repeating them. This does not mean that Genbu unconditionally adhere to the judgments of anyone older than them; learning is a constant process that continues until death for the Genbu and individuals of all ages are expected to collaborate and share their own views on issues. Even if Genbu generally consider those with more overall knowledge to be better equipped for life, unique perspectives and insight can be just more important when dealing with a relevant situation.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Di Jun</span></a> is worshipped by most Genbu due to his role as the patron god of Genbu, though <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Thaldar</span></a> and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Eilettyn</span></a> are popular as well. Genbu serving as a civil servants often look to Thaldar as representative of their duties, while those interested in more dangerous or arcane knowledge find a connection with Eilettyn.
