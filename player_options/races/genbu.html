                Their movements may be slow, but the mind of a Genbu is anything but. In the Dragon Empire Genbu are valued as philosophers, strategists, and advisors due to their inherent sagacity. This sort of wisdom would lead most Genbu to realize a life of adventure is neither stable nor safe, but such insight can't account for individual personality.

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You have a +2 bonus to Wisdom and a +1 bonus to Intelligence. <span class="font-italic">Genbu are highly valued in the Dragon Empire as advisors and teachers.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature. <span class="font-italic">Genbu are very heavy, but not very tall, with most barely reaching a height of five feet when standing up straight &#40;though Genbu usually stand slightly hunched over&#41; yet weighing weighing between 250 and 300 pounds due to their dense shells.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 25 foot land speed and a 30 foot swim speed. <span class="font-italic">Their heavy shells slow down Genbu on land, but this is mitigated in the water.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Daitien.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Natural Armor:</span> Your base AC is 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. <span class="font-italic">The thick shell of a Genbu makes it impossible to wear armor effectively, but it provides significant protection on its own.</span></li>

            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Withdraw:</span> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell. <span class="font-italic">Genbu can retreat into their durable shells for safety.</span></li>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Example Names</h2>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Male Given Names&#58;</span> Dyan, Hiyen, Zokrum, Arrek, Gorek</li>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Genbu are bipedal, humanoid tortoises that stand upright, although many walk with a slight hunch to help support the weight of the thick shells that protect their backs. The leathery scales of Genbu can vary somewhat in color, with the most common colors being shades of brown, yellow, and green. Genbu shells have a similar range of color variance, but many Genbu choose to decorate their shells or paint them with vivid colors that may represent anything from one's ancestry to one's age and occupation. Genbu are somewhat stocky, but not as much as their weight would suggest; the majority of a Genbu's weight actually comes from their extremely dense and protective shells. It takes a relatively long time for Genbu to reach adulthood compared to most other races, about 25 years, and have an average lifespan of 200 years.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                When the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Dragon Empire</span></a> was formed it was the Genbu that were chosen to make many decisions in its governance. Quickly gaining a reputation for fairness and wisdom in their suggestions, Genbu earned respect as the moderating presence behind the ruling <a href="../races/tatsu.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Tatsu</span></a>. However, the sage advice of prominent Genbu was not only used for civil services, and many <a href="../races/tengu.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Tengu</span></a> generals kept Genbu retainers as military advisors. More ambitious Genbu chose not to offer their services as advisors at all, instead striking out on their own to become merchants or claim their own land. Many of these enterprising individuals would become founders of long-lasting merchant families or even see their land develop into fully-fledged cities through the generations.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Knowledge is extremely valuable to Genbu, not just its procurement, but also its application. Knowledge is not only useless if lost, but also if it not used in some way. Many Genbu look to history and the wisdom of their elders when making decisions so that they can learn lessons from past mistakes instead of repeating them. This does not mean that Genbu unconditionally adhere to the judgments of anyone older than them; learning is a constant process that continues until death for the Genbu and individuals of all ages are expected to collaborate and share their own views on issues. Even if Genbu generally consider those with more overall knowledge to be better equipped for life, unique perspectives and insight can be just more important when dealing with a relevant situation.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Alignment and Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Genbu have a naturally Neutral disposition, and if a Genbu does stray toward any particular alignment it usually happens later in life when they have had time to develop a philosophical outlook to live by. Similarly, most Genbu do not pick a deity to worship easily, and if not taken in by some sort of divine calling they spend much time pondering what deity they would have the most favorable relationship with.
