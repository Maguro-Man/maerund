                Honor and strength are two sides of the same coin for Ul'Raathi. The weak cannot be trusted to keep their word, and those who cannot keep their word are weak for it. An honest Ul'Raathi's oath is as strong as his sword arm, which is not an insignificant commendation.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Ul'Raathi are not only tall, but are also very muscular, and their intimidating appearance can make them appear even larger than they already are. Male Ul'Raathi have larger and more visible muscles, but female Ul'Raathi are no weaker despite appearing smaller. Skin colors vary somewhat between different shades of green, yellow, and brown. The most common skin colors for Ul'Raathi are darker shades of olive and tan. Ul'Raathi eye colors some in a similar range to their skin colors, except they are most usually mostly yellow, with  mostly brown and green eyes being much more rare. A striking feature of the Ul'Raathi are the ram-like horns that protrude from above their ears. They grow indefinitely over the lifespan of an Ul'Raathi and must be filed regularly to prevent them from getting too long or growing in problematic directions; men tend to keep their horns longer than women, with some women preferring to leave very little tusk growth at all.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Ancient Ul'Raathi were a militaristic people divided between dozens of clans that fought for dominance over the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Tor'Gathi Isles</span></a>. They were also accomplished sailors and when Ul'Raathi clans were not busy warring with each other, they would often sail to the coastlines of Origus to stage raids on unsuspecting villages. Early Ul'Raathi warriors were not necessarily ruthless, but knew little other than warfare, and it was not until the unification of the Tor'Gathi Isles under the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Tor'Gathi League</span></a> that Ul'Raathi civilization would begin to advance. United as the Tor'Gathi League, the remaining sovereign Ul'Raathi clans made us of their alliance and peace time to not only develop their own territories, but also trade with each other and eventually make use of their naval technology to trade with other races in far-away lands. The militaristic nature of Ul'Raathi did not disappear, but had to be redefined for this new era: new codes of honor were introduced into Ul'Raathi warrior culture to maintain their alliance and the importance of trade with foreign peoples meant that indiscriminate sea raids could no longer be allowed.
            </p> 
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The Ul'Raathi are traditionally a seafaring people, and many make their fortunes on the high seas as sailors, privateers, and merchants. It is common for most able Ul'Raathi adults to be away from home for extended periods of time for business, returning home to rest and spend the coin they earned trading or plundered as a mercenary. Honor and reputation are extremely important to Ul'Raathi and even Ul'Raathi who lack strong morals may be hesitant to break their word as it only makes life more difficult in the long run. Ul'Raathi remember oaths, favors, and treachery very well, and they are unlikely to trust or make deals with anybody they know has a dishonest reputation. There is still an underlying level of esteem for warriors in Ul'Raathi culture, but the general virtues of personal strength, honor, and honest work go beyond just warrior culture for Ul'Raathi. A merchant who makes his wealth through his own skill and honest dealings and a mercenary that honors his contracts and fights well would both earn a similar level of respect from an Ul'Raathi.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                Most Ul'Raathi worship deities that may aid them in their profession in some way, such as some traders worshipping <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Di Jun</span></a> for safe travels and wisdom in their business. Not all Ul'Raathi who share similar professions worship the same deities, as individual priorities are still subjective. For example, a mercenary may worship <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Bulrum</span></a> as they seek glory in battle while one of their comrades may look to <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Agharyx</span></a> because that individual values the honest upholding of contracts and will seek retribution when wronged.
