        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You gain a +2 bonus to Strength and a +1 bonus to Constitution. <span class="font-italic">The physical might of the Ul'Raathi has contributed greatly to their reputation as fearsome warriors.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature. <span class="font-italic">Tall and imposing, the average Ul'Raathi adult is six feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 30 foot land speed.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common, Ul'Raathan, and one extra language of your choice. <span class="font-italic">The Ul'Raathi are a traditionally seafaring people, and both merchants and mercenaries alike learn the languages of their clients in order to ply their trade more effectively.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Unyielding:</span> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright; you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. <span class="font-italic">Soldiers often tell tales of Ul'Raathi mercenaries continuing to fight through seemingly fatal wounds.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Fearless:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. <span class="font-italic">It is extremely difficult to intimidate an Ul'Raathi, though most dare not try in the first place.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Perfect Blow:</span> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. <span class="font-italic">Ul'Raathi warriors are far from simple-minded brutes, and spend much time training to be precise in their strikes.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Tireless Advance:</span> As a bonus action, you can move up to your movement speed toward a hostile creature you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started. <span class="font-italic">Overwhelming force is a mainstay of Ul'Raathi tactics, in part due to the incredible speed at which they can charge their enemies.</span></li>
