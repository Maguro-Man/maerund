                Honor and strength are two sides of the same coin for Ul'Raathi. The weak cannot be trusted to keep their word, and those who cannot keep their word are weak for it. An honest Ul'Raathi's oath is as strong as his sword arm, which is not an insignificant commendation.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Ul'Raathi are not only tall, but are also very muscular, and their intimidating appearance can make them appear even larger than they already are. Male Ul'Raathi have larger and more visible muscles, but female Ul'Raathi are no weaker despite appearing smaller. Skin colors vary somewhat between different shades of green, yellow, and brown. The most common skin colors for Ul'Raathi are darker shades of olive and tan. Ul'Raathi eye colors some in a similar range to their skin colors, except they are most usually mostly yellow, with  mostly brown and green eyes being much more rare. A striking feature of the Ul'Raathi are the tusks that protrude from their lower jaws. They grow indefinitely over the lifespan of an Ul'Raathi and must be filed regularly to prevent them from getting too long or growing in problematic directions; men tend to keep their tusks longer than women, with some women preferring to leave very little tusk growth at all.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Ancient Ul'Raathi were a militaristic people divided between dozens of clans that fought for dominance over the Tor'Gathi Isles.
            </p> 
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The Ul'Raathi are traditionally a seafaring people, and many make their fortunes on the high seas as sailors, privateers, and merchants. It is common for most able Ul'Raathi adults to be away from home for extended periods of time for business, returning home to rest and spend the coin they earned trading or plundered as a mercenary. Honor and reputation are extremely important to Ul'Raathi and even those that lack strong morals may be hesitant to break their word as it makes it difficult to function in society. Ul'Raathi remember oaths, favors, and treachery very well, and news spreads quickly in the Tor'Gathi Isles.
