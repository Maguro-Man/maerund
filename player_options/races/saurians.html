        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a +1 bonus to Wisdom. <span class="font-italic">Though some would not expect it due to their reptilian appearance, Saurians are quite dexterous and spiritual.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 30 foot land speed and a 30 foot swim speed. <span class="font-italic">Saurians possess webbed feet and powerful legs that make swimming as natural as walking for them.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Wyverian.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Darkvision:</span> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. <span class="font-italic">Ancient Saurians would typically hunt at night in order to more easily surprise their prey.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Hold Breath:</span> You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time. <span class="font-italic">Saurians often gather underwater plants for use as food or medicine, or sometimes religious rituals.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Natural Armor:</span> When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor. <span class="font-italic">Thick scales protect Saurians from smaller threats, though armor still sees use in warfare.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Claws:</span> You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. <span class="font-italic">Saurians have extremely sharp claws on their hands that can inflict serious injury.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Wetland Camouflage:</span> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in water or muddy terrain. <span class="font-italic">Hiding just underneath the water is a common tactic used by Saurian hunters and soldiers alike.</span></li>
