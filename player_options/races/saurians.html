                Subtelty and patience followed by explosive execution is how Saurians prefer to put a plan into action. They may sometimes seem overly ponderous or even lethargic when examining a situation, but this is only so that they can be that much quicker when the time comes to act.

        <h2 class="h4">Racial Traits</h2>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Ability Scores:</span> You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a +1 bonus to Wisdom. <span class="font-italic">Though some would not expect it due to their reptilian appearance, Saurians are quite dexterous and spiritual.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Size:</span> You are a Medium creature. <span class="font-italic">Saurians are tall and slender, with an average height of about 6 feet, but their dense muscle makes them surprisingly heavy, weighing on average 210 pounds.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Movement:</span> You have a 30 foot land speed and a 30 foot swim speed. <span class="font-italic">Saurians possess webbed feet and powerful legs that make swimming as natural as walking for them.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Saurian.</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Darkvision:</span> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. <span class="font-italic">Ancient Saurians would typically hunt at night in order to more easily surprise their prey.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Hold Breath:</span> You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time. <span class="font-italic">Saurians often gather underwater plants for use as food or medicine, or sometimes religious rituals.</span></li>

You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor. <span class="font-italic">Thick scales protect Saurians from smaller threats, though armor still sees use in warfare.</span></li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Claws:</span> You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. <span class="font-italic">Saurians have extremely sharp claws on their hands that can inflict serious injury.</span></li>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Saurians are reptilian humanoids with non-prehensile tails that aid them in standing upright. The scales that cover their body come in varying shades of three main colors, green, blue, and brown. These scales tend to be darker, blending in well with various wetland environments. Saurian eyes are more vibrant than their scales, coming in a wide range of colors that shine brightly due to their efficiency at capturing light. The lives of Saurians were originally very quick and violent, meaning adulthood had to come early, usually by the age of 14. However, modern civilization has allowed to more easily reach their average maximum lifespan of 100 years, so though physical maturation occurs quickly, most Saurians are not considered adults until about the age of 20.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">History</h2>
            <p>
                Saurians originate from a region dominated by wetlands in southern <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Origus</span></a>. The environment made technological and infrastructural advancement difficult for early Saurians, however this does not mean Saurians were intellectually primitive. Ancient Saurian thinkers developed philosophies that would spread across <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Maerund</span></a> and Saurian temples would become famous for their elaborate designs, attracting religious pilgrims of many other races. Cities would eventually form as Saurian populations were drawn to dryer regions, though smaller communities would still continue to exist in the wetlands. The centralization of Saurians to large cities allowed for a united government to be formed, establishing the nation of <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Telisk Velast</span></a>.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Hunting and gathering plays a large role in Saurian culture, especially for those living too deep in the wetlands for farming to be possible. Even for Saurians that are able to farm or live in large cities, hunting for food is still popular as a sport and a way of honoring old traditions. Spirituality is also important to most Saurians, and though this usually comes in the form of religion, it does not always have to. Self-reflection and taking time to think about the world is encouraged in general, whether or not prayer to a deity is involved. This juxtaposition between violent hunting culture and spirituality can be confusing and seem contradictory to other races at times, but to Saurians it is a simple desire for balance in life. Saurians believe that in order to survive in the world, one has to be able to act quickly and violently, but also that in order to live a proper life, one has to take the time to think upon its deeper meanings as well.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Religion</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Virela</span></a> and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Di Jun</span></a> see the most worship by Saurians, and oftentimes worshippers will pay respect to both deities in some capacity. Virela is favored by hunters and farmers, especially those living in deeper wetlands, while Di Jun attracts city-dwellers and those who are more concerned with spirituality. Saurians that leave Telisk Velast usually pray to Di Jun in order to not forget their people's spirituality as well as to beseech his protection on their travels.
