            <p>
                Izanami is the goddess of mortal cycles: seasons, life, and death. She sees mortals as children to be guided through the difficulties of life and death, providing warmth and security at its beginning and end. Izanami does not grant her favor to those who cause suffering for others, but even the most abhorrent individuals can find pity and even forgiveness from The Celestial Mother when death comes for them. As a goddess of natural cycles, Izanami despises the creation of undead &#40;though she does not necessarily hold contempt for the undead themselves unless they deliberately brought about their own undeath&#41; and encourages the destruction of both undead and their creators so that the balance of life and death can be preserved. Though she is wary of resurection of the dead, she will generally not forbid it as long as natural life isn't circumvented entirely, such as through undeath or the perpetual reversal of aging.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Worshippers</h2>
            <p>
                Izanami attracts a wide variety of worshippers, especially those that interact with the creation of life, deal with the dead, or rely on the cycles of the seasons, such as midwives, gravediggers, and farmers. The terminally ill and mortally wounded often pray to Izanami for a painless journey to the afterlife, and she is known to provide comfort when one prays to her in their last moments. Devout followers of Izanami work to maintain the sancitity of life in various ways. Common duties include presiding over funerals or helping to deliver children, and those willing to place themselves in danger will even hunt undead and the necromancers that create them. Some worshippers are more concerned with the experience of living than the beginning and end of it; these worshippers instead work to minimize suffering in their community, healing the sick and injured, and providing care for those who cannot be cured of their ailments.
            </p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Mother of the Celestial Order</h2>
            <p>
                Izanami is credited with the creation of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Celestial Order</span></a>, the pantheon of deities most commonly worshipped in <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Izashima</span></a>. Though most deities rule over their their plane of existstence alone, Izanami's loneliness drove her to create other deities to keep her company, <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Omoikane</span></a>, <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Hachiman</span></a>, <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Inari</span></a>, and <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Amaterasu</span></a>. However, Izanami eventually realized that what she had created were siblings, and that what she truly desired were children. To this end, Izanami created mortal children that would walk the <a href="https://5etools.com/book.html#PHB,13,the%20material%20plane,0" target=_blank><span class="text-warning">Material Plane</span></a> and suggested the rest of the Celestial Order to do the same for themselves. <a href="../../player_options/races/tatsu.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Tatsu</span></a> believe they are the mortal children that Izanami created, and the other races of Izashima credit other deities of the Celestial Order for their own creation as well. However, the veracity of such beliefs is unknown as the Celestial Order considers all their worshippers to be their children regardless of race and will speak no further about the issue.
