        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Titles:</span> &ldquo;The Jade Tortoise&rdquo; &ldquo;The Great Sage&rdquo; &ldquo;Seeker of Knowledge&rdquo;</li>
            <li><span class="inline-title lead">Symbol:</span> A green tortoise shell with &ldquo;Immortal Knowledge&rdquo; written on it in Daitien.</li>

            <p>
                Omoikane is a god of sharing and seeking knowledge. He is also a god of travel, as the movement of people also facilitates the movement of ideas. He grants favor to those who collect, protect, and pass down knowledge in the hopes that mortals will become more enlightened and lead better lives for it. Omoikane does not like to judge knowledge as being good or bad and prefers to allow mortals to come to their own conclusions on such matter; this does not mean he does not hold his own opinions on the value of different information, but he chooses not to share such opinions with worshippers so that mortals may learn on their own. Despite his deific status, Omoikane does not believe he necessarily knows better than mortals in all matters, and watches in earnest as new generations learn from their predecessors. For Omoikane, this passing down of knowledge is a form of immortality that he believes can allow mortals, as a collective, to one day hold as much knowledge as any truly immortal beings.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Worshippers</h2>
            <p>
                Worship of Omoikane is extremely popular among most academics and scholars, as well as any other professions that involve the safeguarding and passing on of knowledge. Non-scholarly travelers sometimes pray to Omoikane for safe travels, on the condition that they will share the lessons and experiences they gather on their journeys. Professional trades that pass down their discovers and advancements to future generations may also gain the favor of Omoikane, but the secretive nature of most businesses makes this rare as Omoikane opposes keeping secret knowledge for oneself &#40;the hiding or destruction of knowledge one believes to be dangerous and harmful to society as a whole is an exception, assuming it is done in good faith and the individual does not use that knowledge for themselves&#41;. Priests dedicated to Omoikane spend their time collecting and archiving knowledge from around their world, and have founded some of the world's greatest academies. Many priests also serve as teachers in less affluent communities in order to make knowledge more accessible to those who cannot afford to pay for schooling.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-3">Sage of the Celestial Order</h2>
            <p>
                Omoikane is a member of the <a href="#"><span class="text-warning">Celestial Order</span></a>, a group of deities created and led by <a href="izanami.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Izanami</span></a>. The Celestial Order was originally created to keep Izanami company, and Omoikane did so by challenging Inazami's intellect. He would present philosophical riddles to her and they would spend years of their immortal lives debating on figurative issues. When Izanami decided that the Celestial Order needed mortal followers to feel truly complete, it is said that Omoikane created the <a href="../../player_options/races/genbu.html" target="_blank"><span class="text-warning">Genbu</span></a> race, though this is impossible to confirm as the Celestial Order refers to all their worshippers equally as their &ldquo;children&rdquo;. Though the Celestial Order now all have their own agendas to attend to rather than serving merely as company for Izanami, Omoikane still tries to find time to approach Izanami with new philosophical exercises when he can.
